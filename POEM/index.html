<h1> enough.</h1>

<p> 
    
    when you start to feel
    you will never be good enough
    perphaps, there is room
    for this moment 
    to be enough: 
    enough room to breathe
    enough room to think 
    enough room to laugh
    at the most ridiculous, silly thing 
    enough room to listen 
    to something overheard
    and contemplate the meaning 
    and why you think 
    they chose that word. 
    enough room to look around 
    a bustling crowded the room
    and dream for other people
    what good things they must do; 
    ten minutes from now, 
    ten years from now, 
    imagine the very best for them.
    even if they are strangers. 
    take a simple, mindful, moment for them. 
    even when you feel 
    you will never be good enough 
    keep your eyes wide open
    keep your heart
    filled with love, 
    and whatever is right
    and whatever is true 
    let that be enough 
    to carry you through, 
    when you start to feel 
    you will never be good enough. 
    Morgan Harper Nichols
