<h1> enough.</h1>

<p> 
    
    when you start to feel <br>
    you will never be good enough <br>
    perphaps, there is room <br>
    for this moment  <br>
    to be enough: <br>
    enough room to breathe <br>
    enough room to think  <br>
    enough room to laugh <br>
    at the most ridiculous, silly thing  <br>
    enough room to listen <br>
    to something overheard <br>
    and contemplate the meaning  <br>
    and why you think  <br>
    they chose that word. <br>
    enough room to look around <br>
    a bustling crowded the room <br>
    and dream for other people<br>
    what good things they must do; <br>
    ten minutes from now, <br>
    ten years from now, <br>
    imagine the very best for them.<br>
    even if they are strangers. <br>
    take a simple, mindful, moment for them. <br>
    even when you feel <br>
    you will never be good enough <br>
    keep your eyes wide open <br>
    keep your heart <br>
    filled with love,  <br>
    and whatever is right <br>
    and whatever is true <br>
    let that be enough <br>
    to carry you through, <br>
    when you start to feel  <br>
    you will never be good enough. <br>
